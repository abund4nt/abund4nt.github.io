<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Lukas â€” a 19-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast and offensive security specialist. My journey with technology started at a very young age, and I quickly found myself drawn to the world of hacking, ethical exploitation, and digital defense.</p>
<p>By the time I was 17, my passion and dedication led me to land my first job in the cybersecurity industry, where I began working professionally in offensive security. Since then, I&rsquo;ve devoted most of my time to deepening my skills, researching vulnerabilities, and participating in real-world security assessments.</p>
<p>Beyond cybersecurity, Iâ€™m deeply interested in artificial intelligence and how it can be combined with security to build smarter, more resilient systems. I&rsquo;m also driven by the desire to create meaningful projects â€” ones that can truly make an impact in the world.</p>
<p>This blog is where I share my thoughts, projects, experiments, and experiences as I continue to grow in this exciting and ever-evolving field.</p>
